# Web Application Challenge
Heyo and welcome to this project! (I promise that I'm not a youtuber ehehe)

After a few coffees and some good food, I finish my challenge. :) 

Inside this repository you will find a client side application, written in React and a server side (Backend) written in Node.Js.
Inside both folders you also have a README that explains to you how to install and run it.
Hope you like it!


Best regards,

Barbara
